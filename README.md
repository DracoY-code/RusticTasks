# RusticTasks

This is a To-Do List app implemented in `Rust` and `GTK4`. I wanted to work on a tangible project once I was done with the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/). So, this is an incremental project that I worked on to clear up certain concepts specific to Rust programming. I would be adding onto this project as I learn more about Rust programming and GUI development.

## Work That Has Been Done

- A preliminary To-Do List logic was implemented.
- A CSV-based database was implemented.
- Simple UIs for the login and the list were implemented.
- The login page logic was implemented into the app.

## Future Implementations

- Clean up the unncessary logic.
- Implement a menubar and a sidebar.
- Implement keyboard shortcuts.
- Implement collections.
- Prettify the UI.

## Resources

- [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/)
